# Fixed-End Beam Analysis using Finite Element Method

This project presents an analysis of a **fixed-end beam** using the **finite element method (FEM)**, based on the study by **Kartunnen & Von Hertzen** in their 2016 article, [Exact theory for a linearly elastic interior beam](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.09.010).

## Overview

The analysis models a **2D solid beam under plane stress conditions**, incorporating:

- A **rectangular** cross-section (constant along the length)
- A **constant** superficial load applied to the upper face
- **Linearly elastic material behavior**
- Governing equations for **axial force, shear force, and bending moment**

## Features

- Implementation of the **finite element method** for beam analysis
- Consideration of **boundary conditions** for a fixed-end beam
- Mathematical formulation and numerical solution based on the referenced study
